A more efficient Alternative to REST

1. **Increased mobile usage creates need for efficient data loading**

   ncreased mobile usage, low-powered devices and sloppy networks were the initial reasons why Facebook developed GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.

2. **Variety of different fronted frameworks and platforms on the client-side**

   The heterogeneous(#各种各样的，混杂的) landscape of frontend frameworks and platforms that run client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access precisely the data it needs.

3. **Fast development & expectation for rapid feature development**

   Continuous deployment has become a standard for many companies, rapid iterations and frequent product updates are indispensable(#不可避免，必不可少). With REST APIs, the way data is exposed by the server often needs to be modified to account for specific requirements and design changes on the client-side. This hinders fast development practices and product iterations.
